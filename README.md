# Dolphin-SU
Dolphin shortcut to run Dolphin as SuperUser

Place this Dolphin-SU.desktop file into ~/.local/share/applications/
Make sure it is set to executable!

It should then show up in your KDE kickoff menu

It is working for me on OpenMandriva ROME Wayland. It is not working for me on X11. It may for you. Please let me know if it does.

For the icon associated with the shortcut, I prefer to change the default one to folder-important since it is red and looks different from the default dolphin icon. When selecting the icon, just change the pull down menu to ALL and type in folder-important.
